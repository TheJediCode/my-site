            <p>For as long as I can remember, I've been a person of many passions. From writing     and illustrating comic books and digital art as a child, to writing computer code and     novels as an adult, I have always sought avenues to express myself. In my early     twenties, I rekindled my love for computers.</p>
            <p>What began as a hobby modding Star Wars video games has blossomed into a     bountiful career path creating and designing websites. It is my hope to share my    passion with you, to make your life easier, and to create something that reflects  what you want and can be proud to show people, to be proud to say "This is <em>my</em> website."</p>
